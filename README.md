## Advent of Code 2020 in [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/clojure-%238FB5FE.svg?&style=flat&logo=clojure&logoColor=white" />](https://clojure.org)
Run files with the input file as argument, like `clojure "Day 1/part_1.clj" "my-input.txt"`.

I've included my inputs.

Part 1 and part 2 of a given day are mostly repetitive (I've copied most functions verbatim), but I've separated them to enhance readability.
